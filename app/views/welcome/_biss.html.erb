<div class="statement">
	<p>The Internet has the potential to be the greatest democratizing and connecting force the human race has ever known. The rapid transfer of information on a universally available and content-neutral network can give voice to those who have been voiceless, can educate all of us, and can lay the groundwork for the most broadly informed, engaged society imaginable. On the other hand, a non-neutral Internet can create dangerous monopolies on information, which will in turn further disenfranchise the weak and further empower the strong.</p>

	<p>The FCC is faced with the decision of which of these two worlds to create. I strongly urge you to choose the first vision.</p>
