	“Net neutrality is incredibly important to me and to The Starter League’s tech entrepreneurs. Our school has taught over 1,000 beginners how to build web apps on the Internet to solve practical, real-world problems. Limiting access to an open Internet would be detrimental to these startups and to the public. It would stifle economic activity if we allow unfair advantages for already-established companies who can afford to pay for internet “fast lanes." Similarly, allowing Internet service providers to charge consumers extra to access new content or services would make it harder and more expensive for the public, not only to benefit from the rewards of innovation, but also to exchange their ideas about the world. </p>

	Fortunately, we can avoid these unfair, anti-competitive outcomes. When the FCC meets later this year, they can and should reclassify broadband Internet as a Title II common carrier. That way, we can ensure real net neutrality, protect consumers, and eliminate gatekeeper power over web content and services. This is about the public interest. We hope that decision makers will decide to keep the Internet open for the free exchange of commerce and ideas.”
