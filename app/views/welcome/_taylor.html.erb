<div class="statement">
	<p>
		Imagine an interstate highway system that only a privileged few could travel. Then, imagine that the largest cable and cell phone companies determined who those privileged few were, based on how much those companies stood to benefit? This is exactly the situation we face on the information superhighway if the long-standing principle of Net Neutrality is weakened or overturned by the FCC. The proposed ability of these companies to restrict access to internet bandwidth will stunt the growth of innovative and creative new technology companies that both provide good paying jobs to Chicagoland and provide services and content that make all of our lives better.

		If you care about a healthy internet ecosystem and about your personal freedom to choose the online services you use and access, the clock is ticking on the FCC's decision, so now is the time to act by contacting the FCC and your legislators and telling them that Net Neutrality is important to you!
